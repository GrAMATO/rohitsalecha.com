summary: Training on DevSecOps
abstract: "Modern enterprises are implementing the technical and cultural changes required to embrace  DevOps methodology. DevSecOps extends DevOps by introducing security early into the SDLC process, thereby minimizing the security vulnerabilities and enhancing the software security posture. In this workshop, we will show how this can be achieved through a series of live demonstrations and practical examples using open source tools.
As part of this workshop attendees will receive a state-of-the-art DevSecOps tool-chest comprising of various open-source tools and scripts to help the DevOps engineers in automating security within the CI/CD pipeline. While the workshop uses Java/J2EE framework, the workshop is language agnostic and similar tools can be used against other application development frameworks.The workshop will also present various case studies on how critical bugs and security breaches affecting popular software and applications could have been prevented using a simple DevSecOps approach."
